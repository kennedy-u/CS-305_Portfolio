- What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

  - I enjoyed running functional test and a secondary dependency volunerability check via static testing method to ensure that most of the volunerabilities were found and mitigated. Secure coding practices is important to incorporate in all part of SDLC because developers and administrators not only need to protect their client's data but also their client's user's data.   

- What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  - I had a

- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?


- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?


- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?


- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
