This deliveray is Practices for Secure Software Security Testing protocols.




Client = Artemis Financial.

Their Software Requirements = Examining Artemis Financial’s software to address any security vulnerabilities.
This required me to refactor their software code base in order to add functionality to meet software security requirements for Artemis Financial’s applications. 

The steps outlined below were followed to address and remedy all areas in the Practices for Secure Software Report. 

I was able to determined an appropriate encryption algorithm cipher to deploy given security vulnerabilities.  

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

Generated an appropriate self-sighned certifcates using the Java Keytool.


Deployed Cipher, this was done by deploying and implementing the encryption algorithm cipher to the software application. In addition, I verified this process by using a checksum verification process. 

In the appplication.property file I refactored the code base to convert HTTP to the HTTPS protocol. 

A secodary static testing was implemented using a dependency check tool to make that the software complies with software security enhancements.

A functional test was performed with coverage, displaying the part of the integral internal code that actually performed the use case dessigned for the software and as well as identifying a syntactinca, logical, security vulnerabiltiy for the software security by manually inspecting the code 

The resources, tools used in this practice involves using the Java Security Standard algorithm types, java keytool for creating certificate authority (CA), and the Maven Dependency check plugin (OWASP Dependency -Check-Maven)
